  You can set point, curve with arrow or mesh to the rhino viewport with ArchiVision. So it is easy to get a beautiful diagram with the command called ViewCaptureToFile when you are modeling.
  
  
  This plugin has all linetype in your Rhino Document and all type of points that Rhino provides. Please enjoy it!
